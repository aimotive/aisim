# aiSim Archer: a cutting-edge 3D vehicle model for simulation excellence

Meet aiSimArcher, our latest creation that embodies aiMotive's understanding of the new OpenMATERIAL standard (ASAM OpenMATERIAL 3D :: OpenMATERIALÂ® 3D). This versatile, fictitious vehicle is designed to combine modern car aesthetics with real-time rendering optimization, making it the perfect example for standard-driven 3D simulation.

## Key features:

- High-resolution design: Comprising approximately 140,000 triangles, aiSimArcher boasts intricate exterior details and a simplified schematic interior for streamlined performance.

- Standards-compliant structure: Faithfully adheres to ASAM OpenMATERIAL 3D hierarchy, transformations, pivot-placement, and naming conventions.

- Realistic lighting: The model includes 23 optimized light nodes prepared for detailed light source setup for realistic and performance-efficient renders.

- Unmatched customization: Fully UV-unwrapped layout for seamless texturing and parameter-driven materials, with additional tire normal maps for high-quality visuals.

- Ready for integration: A complete package featuring a glTF 3D model, texture files, and an `.xoma` descriptor for easy implementation.
